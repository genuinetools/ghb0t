# ghb0t

[![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/chris-short/ghb0t.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chris-short/ghb0t)

A GitHub Bot to automatically delete your fork's branches after a pull request
has been merged.

> **NOTE:** This will **never** delete a branch named "master" AND will
**never** delete a branch that is not owned by the current authenticated user.
If the pull request is closed _without_ merging, it will **not** delete it.
